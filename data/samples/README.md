# Data Samples to Classify

## Description of data

- AM - alveolar macrophages (total lung) taken D20 after MTB infection
- MDM - monocyte derived macrophages (total lung) taken D20 after MTB infection
- AW pos - alveolar macrophages isolated from airway, D18 after MTB infection
- AW neg - alveolar macrophages isolated from interstitium (deeper lung tissue), D18 after MTB infection.
- galagan - time series hypoxia studies from Galagan lab

## AM and MDM data
- Eliza, 7/2/2020
  - Using differentially expressed genes and looking at whether these genes were also differentially expressed in AM vs MDM, we found a significant late hypoxia signature in MDMs. 
The AMs had a significant overlap with early/mid hypoxia differentially expressed genes. So, my expectation was that there would be a difference in terms of hypoxia state.
 - Again, using differentially expressed genes we found the AW_plus had a late hypoxia signature, but not the AW_neg.
