1. feature_analyzer creates feature sets of size n
2. feature_set_analyzer
   a. test makeNonIntersectingSets
   b. plot feature set accuracies
3. Update multi_classifier.py and tests
  -- ensemble of features
  -- ensemble of instance holdouts
4. Feature set value plot
   a. Indicates the trinary value of each feature in
      a feature set. The value is the sign of
      of the parameter, with 0 for small values.
  b. Structure
     x - feature set
     y - number of features in the set
     color of each bar in stack
       blue: -1
       grey: 0
       red:  1
5. Feature set difference plot. (Diagnostic)
  a. Evaluates an instance of a trinary feature vector
     for a binary classifier
  b. Structure
     x - feature set
     y - number of features in the set
     color of each bar in stack
       blue: same trinary value in classifier & sample
       grey: differs by 1
       red: differs by 2
