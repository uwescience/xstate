0. FeatureSet.evaluate
1. FeatureSetCollection.plotEvaluate. bar height - 2 log10 (SL); xaxis - FeatureSet
along with occurrences counts that comply and dont.
2. Why are there inconsistent results for ser_comb?


1. FeatureSetVector
   a. Assigns a value to each feature organized by
      FeatureSet. dataframe representation
   b. Can do XOR operation between FSV to calc distance
      (calculate abs of difference for same feature, cls)
   c. Plot for different classes.
3. Update multi_classifier.py and tests
  -- ensemble of features
  -- ensemble of instance holdouts
4. Feature set value plot
   a. Indicates the trinary value of each feature in
      a feature set. The value is the sign of
      of the parameter, with 0 for small values.
  b. Structure
     x - feature set
     y - number of features in the set
     color of each bar in stack
       blue: -1
       grey: 0
       red:  1
5. Feature set difference plot. (Diagnostic)
  a. Evaluates an instance of a trinary feature vector
     for a binary classifier
  b. Structure
     x - feature set
     y - number of features in the set
     color of each bar in stack
       blue: same trinary value in classifier & sample
       grey: differs by 1
       red: differs by 2
